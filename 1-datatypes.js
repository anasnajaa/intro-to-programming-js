/* 
Variables 
Variables are similar to buckets, we place things/data inside of them so we can access it or modify it later.
Variables can hold different type of data as well based on our needs.

There are two ways of declaring variables in JavaScript:
1- Using the var keyword
2- using the let keyword
Throughout this course, we will use let keyword exclusively.

Constants
Constants are almost identical to variables except that once we place something inside them, we cannot change its content.
There are exception to this rule which we will discuss at a later stage.

DataTypes

// integers
let age = 11;

// floats
let money = 11.500;

// strings
let name = "First Last";

// boolean
let isSubscribed = false;

// arithmetic operations 

const obj = {};

obj.t = 1;

console.log(obj);

const a = [1,2];

a.push(3);

console.log(a);
